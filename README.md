# 📚 AskDocX — Document Question-Answering System

AskDocX is an AI-powered document question-answering system that allows users to upload PDF files and ask natural language questions about their content. It is built using LangChain, Google Gemini, ChromaDB, and Streamlit, and follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide context-aware responses grounded in uploaded documents.
